-The PCB layout was not originally designed with an enclosure.  Some compromises were made such as
the need to extend the switches and program jumpers and placing some parts on the bottom of the board.
-Case was designed to be laser cut from 3mm acrylic sheet.
-Top cover is held with 15mm long M3 nylon standoffs.
-Bottom cover is held with 6mm long M3 nylon standoffs.
-LCD panel is held using M2.5 nylon screws, a nut and washer are used to provide clearance between the PCBs.
-Button extensions were printed using 0.2mm layer height and 10% infill.
-Some sanding will probably be required to get the extension to fit on the button properly.
